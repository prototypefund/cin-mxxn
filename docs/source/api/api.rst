API-Documentation
=================
The backend of the MXXN framework is programmed in Python, and
the web-based frontend, which runs in browser, is built in 
TypeScript. The communication between frontend and backend
is realized via a REST API. The API documentation below
documents all the code and is intended to provide guidance
to developers.
